        <b>Our Vision</b> <br> <br>
        High Performance Computing is Transforming Our Lives

        Founded in 1969 as a Silicon Valley start-up, the AMD journey began with dozens of employees focused on
        leading-edge semiconductor products. From those modest beginnings, AMD has grown into a global company of 10,000
        people, achieving many important industry firsts along the way. AMD today develops high-performance computing
        and visualization products to solve some of the worldâ€™s toughest and most interesting challenges. There has
        never been a better time to be in the semiconductor industry, and we are ready to tackle the next 50 years with
        high-performance computing and graphics solutions that transform all of our lives.
